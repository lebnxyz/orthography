# TODO (temporary document)

* finish verb initializer (man)
    * ~~collapse `long vowel.long vowel` sequences (generated by conjugating a final-weak verb) into just the second vowel~~
    * ~~implement nfa3al-i fta3al-i and nfa3al-a fta3al-a forms (or maybe **nfi3il/fti3il & nfa3al/fta3al** even tho that breaks the pattern of using 3ms.pst)~~
    * make sure f3ii and f3aa imperatives are in place
    * add all of fa3yit, fi3yit, fi3it, fa3it
    * ~~make sure parseWord is upholding the stress in stuff like `` $`+nFi -3iL` ``~~
* ~~delete stAf3al from verb and pp (probably)~~
* ~~account for final-vowel-plus-suffix combos like mfa33aa+c == mfa33aayc in pp's initializer~~
* add `(2af3al ...)` tag to grammar
* finish the other tags smh
* ~~change mu- to mi- in pp~~
* ~~turn pronoun objects' boolean attrs into methods~~
* ~~add postTransform to parseWord and figure out a way to handle combinations...~~
