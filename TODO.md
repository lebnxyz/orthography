# TODO (temporary document)

* finish verb initializer (man)
    * ~~collapse `long vowel.long vowel` sequences (generated by conjugating a final-weak verb) into just the second vowel~~
    * ~~implement nfa3al-i fta3al-i and nfa3al-a fta3al-a forms (or maybe **nfi3il/fti3il & nfa3al/fta3al** even tho that breaks the pattern of using 3ms.pst)~~
    * ~~make sure f3ii and f3aa imperatives are in place~~
    * ~~add all of fa3yit, fi3yit, fi3it, fa3it~~
    * ~~make sure parseWord is upholding the stress in stuff like `` $`+nFi -3iL` ``~~
    * Figure out how to vary between tinsaani~tinsiini (both for masc), 2it7addaak~2it7addiik, etc.
* ~~delete stAf3al from verb and pp (probably)~~
* ~~account for final-vowel-plus-suffix combos like mfa33aa+c == mfa33aayc in pp's initializer~~
* ~~add `(2af3al ...)` tag to grammar~~
* ~~add `(taf3il ...)` tag to grammar (takes a root and generates $`t.a/i.${$F} ${$3}.ii.${$L}`) **plus t.a/i.F.3.i.y.c ~ t.a/i.F.3.aa.y.c**~~
* ~~Add `(ctx ...)` tag to grammar, e.g. `(ctx [proper noun] [tense final vowel] jOni)` or `` (ctx [self] s`arr~1ms) ``, `ma (ctx [stress] (verb [3ms] [u] [pst] q{w}l|2fs))`~~
* implement the other tags smh
* ~~change mu- to mi- in pp~~
* ~~turn pronoun objects' boolean attrs into methods~~
* ~~add postTransform to parseWord and figure out a way to handle combinations...~~
* Make augmenting a distinct step and allow multiple augmentations (no reason why it couldn't happen!)
* ~~Add metadata to consonants: place, manner, voicing **(grouped by articulator instead of place)**~~
* ~~Update style: enforce commas on the last element of multiline lists, enforce curly-internal spaces only for blocks and not objects~~
* Create a module that exports string tags to map certain strings to numbers (basically what's currently in phoneme-properties.js)
