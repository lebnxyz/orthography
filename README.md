# Orthography walkthrough
This is a quick web walkthrough of my (WIP) proposed Lebanese writing system.

## Development info
`npm run build` to build for production (to `/dist`) and `npm run serve` to develop.

Note that the two `Inter` files included are modified to better support the glyph `U+0269 LATIN SMALL LETTER IOTA`.
