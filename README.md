# Orthography-teaching tool thing

This is a quick web walkthrough of our proposed Lebanese writing system. This orthography business is only peripheral
to the dictionary project itself, but the dictionary will still be optionally available in it, so an accessible

## Usage

`npm run build` to build for production (builds to `/docs` for GitHub Pages' use) and `npm run serve` to develop
