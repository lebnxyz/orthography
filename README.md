# Orthography walkthrough
This is a quick web walkthrough of my (WIP) proposed Lebanese writing system.

## Development info
`npm run build` to build for production (to `/dist`) and `npm run serve` to develop.

Note that the two `Inter` files included were modified to better support the glyph `U+0269 LATIN SMALL LETTER IOTA`. Inter's maintainer has since implemented those changes upstream, so those files will be removed as soon as Inter 3.18+ makes it onto Google Fonts.
